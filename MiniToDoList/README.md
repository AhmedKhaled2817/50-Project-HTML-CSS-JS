## 🚀 How It Works

- The user types a task into the `<input>` field.  
- On clicking the **Add** button:
  - The task is added to the list as a new item.
  - A check icon allows the task to be marked as done (line-through style).
  - A trash icon removes the task from the list.
- Input is validated to prevent adding empty tasks.
