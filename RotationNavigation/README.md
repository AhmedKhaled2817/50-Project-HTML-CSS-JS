This is a **rotating navigation menu UI** built with **HTML**, **CSS (Bootstrap + custom styles)**, and **JavaScript**. It demonstrates a unique UX interaction where the main container rotates to reveal a side navigation.

## 💡 Features

- Smooth rotating animation using CSS transforms
- Interactive open/close navigation button
- Responsive design (mobile & desktop)
- Uses **FontAwesome** icons and **Bootstrap 5**
- Content fades with beautiful transitions
- Separate content and image sections

## 📁 Project Structure

- `index.html` – Page layout and structure
- `assets/css/style.css` – Core styles and animation
- `assets/css/responsive.css` – Mobile responsiveness
- `assets/js/main.js` – Button click event handlers
- `assets/img/dog.avif` – Image used in the content

## 🚀 How It Works

- The navigation buttons are placed inside a large rotating circle
- Clicking the **open** button rotates the main `.container` by -20 degrees
- Navigation items slide into view with staggered animation
- JavaScript toggles a class `.show-nav` to control rotation and nav visibility

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- How to use `transform: rotate()` with `transform-origin`
- Toggle animations via JS class control
- Create interactive UI without heavy frameworks
- Media queries for mobile responsiveness
